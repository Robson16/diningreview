# Dining Review API

This project is the final assignment for the **Create REST APIs with Spring and Java** course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

## Overview
The **Dining Review API** is a RESTful web service that enables users to submit reviews for restaurants based on allergy-friendly criteria. Users can rate restaurants on a scale from 1 to 5 for peanut, egg, and dairy safety. Admins review and approve or reject these dining reviews. Additionally, the API recalculates and updates restaurant scores based on approved reviews.

## Features
- **User Reviews:** Users submit dining reviews with scores for peanut, egg, and dairy allergies, plus optional commentary.
- **Score Aggregation:** Restaurants store average scores for each allergy category as well as an overall score, calculated from approved reviews.
- **Admin Actions:** Admins can view pending reviews and update a review's status (approve or reject).
- **Flexible Endpoints:** Routes accept optional parameters (e.g., filtering dining reviews by status).
- **DTO-based Communication:** Both request and response data are managed through DTOs to decouple internal models from the API contract.
- **Global Exception Handling:** Errors and validation issues are managed centrally for clean and consistent API responses.
